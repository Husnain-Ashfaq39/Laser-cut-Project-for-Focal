        Utilising a combination Autodesk's Inventor 3D modelling software. and
        Autodesk's Fusion 360 we are able to create complex 3D models and sheet
        metal parts ensuring the manufacturing process can be well thought-out
        and confirmed before any materials are even ordered.
        <br />
        <br />
        Flattening out these 3D models, we can then cut intricate shapes out on
        our CNC profile cutter and fold on our 5 axis CNC Durma press brake.
        <br />
        <br />
        Full working drawings are produced in-house for customers approval and
        minimising the need for re-work once fabrication and installation has
        begun.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our goal is to remove as much friction as possible for our projects
        reducing leadtimes whilst also minimising the chance of mistakes in
        production or installation.
        <br />
        <br />
        Technology is rapidly evolving and we always strive to be at the
        forefront of adopting new software to increase efficiencies when
        justified.

        Employing skilled tradesman, Focal can fabricate the most challenging
        projects that other businesses shy away from.

        <br />
        Leveraging our design software, we can make light work of challenging to
        make products whether these be from sheet metal, plate or box section.
        <br />
        <br />
        We use a number of different joining techniques including MIG welding,
        TIG welding, silver soldering, riveting and fasteners and will use the
        option that is fit for purpose.
        <br />
        <br />
        Combining CNC profile cutting and a CNC press brake, we are able to
        create complex parts that can then be fabricated, welded, metal finished
        and installed..
        <br />
        <br />
        We are a solutions based business and as engineers, we genuinely thrive
        and work well as a team to figure out how something can be made rather
        than give customers reasons why it canâ€™t.
        <br />
        <br />
        You would be hard pressed to find another group of fabricators that have
        the diverse skill range as ours and we we work hard to create a good
        environment that produces top tier work. After all, the projects that we
        are a part of demand it.

        with a 4000mm X 2000mm cutting bed that we will take delivery late
        October 2024.
        <br />
        <br />
        Upgrading to a laser is going to take us to full production capability
        dramatically increasing our speed and accuracy.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our plasma bed is 1500mm wide by 3000mm long meaning that we can cut
        oversized sheets and be more efficient with material and reducing the
        amount of joins needed on long runs.
        <br />
        <br />
        This unit can cut from 0.5mm thick metal up to 16mm thick plate. The
        laser will be able to cut up to 40mm mild steel. We can cut steel,
        stainless steel, brass, aluminium or copper and stock all commonly used
        materials.
        <br />
        <br />
        Supply agreements are in place so that we have stock on-hand and can
        reliably get hold of hard to get materials such as brass and copper
        including oversized brass sheets.
        <br />
        <br />
        For cut only jobs, we try our best to get these back to a customer
        within 5 working days.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our in-house design team can quickly draw up items for you or we are
        more than happy to take your cut-ready DXF files that you have drawn on
        CAD.

        <br />
        Over the years, we have been asked to produce countless finishes and
        have accumulated an in-depth knowledge of how different metals will
        react in different situations to different chemicals.
        <br />
        <br />
        Leveraging this knowledge and the knowledge from our abrasive suppliers,
        we can consistently achieve great results in a timely manner.

        <br />
        Whether is be a brush polished stainless bench top, a mirror polished
        part or patinated brass/copper.
        <br />
        <br />
        We invest in the right tools and machinery for the job and have a vast
        array of cool little machines to achieve the right finish. Please ask us
        for samples if you would like them- we know that the finish is the
        critical feature of the product and is what will give you the right feel
        for your home.
        <br />
        <br />
        We are more than happy to provide as many samples as is required to get
        the right finish for the application.

        Our processes mean that all of the heavy lifting has been done in the
        design phase reducing the risk of installs going wrong.
        <br />
        <br />
        We are always able to install the products that we make in the workshop
        and have staff with the skill set required.
        <br />
        <br />
        Utilising the best adhesives, we are able to do glue only installs
        giving a more seamless look where required.
        <br />
        <br />
        We have site welders when required and take the utmost care to reduce
        the risk of fire and/or grinding spark damage and as a rule, will TIG
        weld inside only to minimise risk. Our employees
        <strong>take pride</strong> in their work. We frequently work on
        building sites for new homes that are worth a lot of money.
        <br />
        <br />
        We <strong>respect</strong> other tradesman on site and ensure that we
        work in together and take care to not damage anything in the process.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the unlikely event that damage does occur, we are more than willing
        to take responsibility and rectify the situation and have the correct
        insurances in place.
