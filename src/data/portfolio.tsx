        At Focal, we specialize in custom metal fabrication services that are
        tailored to meet the unique needs of each of our clients.
        <br />
        <br />
        With the pandemic causing significant delays in shipping, one of our
        clients who would typically import their furniture from Europe
        approached us with a request to create a bespoke room divider that would
        meet their high standards of quality while being delivered within a
        reasonable timeframe.
        <br />
        <br />
        To bring this project to life, we partnered with a local joinery company
        to create a timber sub-frame that would serve as the foundation of the
        room divider.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our team of skilled metalworkers then crafted a powder-coated frame that
        allowed for the hot-rolled steel to be clad around the divider with
        hidden push-to-open latches that allowed for storage in the bottom of
        the unit.
        <br />
        <br />
        To add a pop of color to the room divider, we included orange and grey
        boxes that can be moved around the divider as the client wishes.
        <br />
        <br />
        These boxes were sprayed with a high-gloss lacquer finish by a skilled
        local painter that Focal also works closely with.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our team at Focal has extensive experience in bespoke metalwork and
        joinery, and we understand that these two disciplines often come hand in
        hand.
        <br />
        <br />
        We are proud to have established a great relationship with a local
        joinery company that shares our commitment to quality craftsmanship and
        attention to detail.
        <br />
        <br />
        When you choose Focal for your custom metal fabrication needs, you can
        expect a highly personalized experience that is centered around your
        unique design requirements.
        <br />

        Our team works closely with you at every stage of the process, from
        initial design through to final installation, to ensure that you are
        completely satisfied with the end result.

      <p className="text-md pt-5 font-body">
        At Focal we specialise in creating custom metalwork that is tailored to
        meet the unique needs of each of our clients.
        <br />
        <br />
        Recently, we had the opportunity to work on a spectacular turn-key build
        for the luxury residential market, which included designing bespoke
        pendant lights in collaboration with Roz Hamilton Interiors.
        <br />
        <br />
        We worked closely with Roz to design these lights, and we were thrilled
        with the outcome.
        <br />
        <br />
        The process of creating these pendant lights was complex and
        challenging, requiring a high degree of precision and expertise.
        <br />
        <br />
        The ring for the pendant lights was first laser cut from flat sheet
        material.
        <br />
        <br />
        We then rolled the inner and outer rings to fit the desired radius.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once the radius had been formed, we used TIG welding to join the pieces
        together, creating a single, unified ring.
        <br />
        <br />
        It took over 16 metres of welding to create the lights, making this
        project truly time-consuming and challenging.
        <br />
        <br />
        To complement the bespoke pendant lights, we worked with a company in
        Auckland to source hand-blown lamp shades, which were then paired with
        imported antique-style lamp holders from the UK.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once completed, we spray-painted the pendant lights a sleek satin black
        in-house and worked alongside an electrician to install them to the
        client's satisfaction.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our team at Focal has extensive experience in bespoke metalwork and
        fabrication, and we pride ourselves on our attention to detail, quality
        craftsmanship, and commitment to working closely with our clients to
        bring their vision to life.

      <p className="text-md pt-5 font-body">
        Focal's passion for metal fabrication extends to creating stunning
        bespoke fireplaces that add warmth and character to any space. Our team
        works closely with interior designers and architects to design and build
        fireplaces that match their clients' vision and budget.
        <br />
        <br />
        We understand that fireplaces are more than just a source of heat; they
        are a focal point in any room and a place for family and friends to
        gather around. That's why we take pride in our work and strive to create
        the ultimate fireplace for our clients.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our expertise in metal fabrication allows us to create folded edges that
        are welded, sanded, and polished to give a seamless look that
        complements the rest of the space. We take a unique approach to each
        project, ensuring that every detail is carefully considered, and the end
        result is a beautiful, functional work of art.
        <br />
        <br />
        One popular option for fireplaces is hot-rolled steel, which gives a
        blackened steel look. If the fireplace is for indoor use, we seal it
        with a beeswax finish to protect it from rust and give it a smooth,
        elegant finish. For outdoor fireplaces, we use a matt clear powder coat
        that provides a protective layer against the elements and gives it a
        long-lasting finish.
        <br />
        <br />
        We also work with other types of metal for fireplaces, such as brass and
        copper. Using these materials, we can create specialty antique finishes
        using patina acids, which can give a unique look to the fireplace that
        truly stands out from others. We are happy to create a sample palette of
        different finishes so that you can choose the one that best suits your
        style and needs.
        <br />
        <br />
        At Focal, we are always excited to work on new and unique projects. If
        you have an idea for a fireplace, don't hesitate to get in touch with
        us. We would love to discuss your project with you and see how we can
        bring your vision to life.
        <br />
        <br />
        We have created many stunning fireplaces for our clients over the years,
        and we would be happy to show you some examples in our showroom. We
        respect our clients' privacy, and if you prefer not to have your project
        shared on the internet, we completely understand and will ensure that
        your privacy is protected.

        Focal will also work in the commercial setting when the right projects
        are presented to us.
        <br />
        <br />
        Recently, we jumped at the opportunity to be a part of the fit-out for
        the new Patagonia clothing store in Queenstown in conjunction with AJ
        Saville Builders and Masterwood Joinery.
        <br />
        <br />
        There was a lot of heart and sole that went into this project and we
        think that the results speak for themselves. With an overall rustic
        style throughout, we once again had to fabricate intricate sheet metal
        parts and install these into the finished store without any blemishes.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are in the store, be sure to check out all of the steel details
        including the beam wraps that cover each junction on the concrete
        columns. Each one of these were measured and patience and skill were
        needed in abundance to execute.

      <p className="text-md pt-5 font-body">
        At Focal, we believe that handrails and balustrades are more than just a
        necessary safety feature - they're an opportunity to enhance the
        aesthetic appeal of your space.
        <br />
        <br />
        We understand that these elements are an integral part of most builds,
        and we have the expertise and experience to design and manufacture
        handrails and balustrades that are both functional and visually
        stunning.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our team of skilled fabricators and welders start the process in our
        workshop, creating each handrail and balustrade to meet the specific
        requirements of your space. We then pre-fit them on site, ensuring that
        every detail is perfect before they are taken away to be powder coated.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once the powder coating is complete, we re-fit the handrails and
        balustrades, welding, polishing, and painting them to ensure a seamless
        finish throughout the entire stairway. Our attention to detail and
        commitment to quality craftsmanship means that you can rest assured that
        your handrails and balustrades will meet all necessary safety
        requirements while also being a beautiful addition to your space.
        <br />
        <br />
        We understand that handrails and balustrades can be tricky to design,
        especially when contending with angles and other factors that can
        complicate the process. That's why we use the latest technology and
        tools, including CAD software, to ensure that every element is a perfect
        fit.
        <br />
        <br />
        At Focal, we have experience working with a range of materials,
        including steel, stainless steel, aluminum, copper, and brass. We can
        also provide specialist finishing and coatings to ensure that your
        handrails and balustrades not only look great but are also durable and
        long-lasting.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you're looking for beautiful, functional handrails and balustrades
        for your space, contact Focal today. Our team is ready to help bring
        your vision to life.
